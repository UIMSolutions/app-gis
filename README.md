**Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**, also known as **Geoinformationssysteme** or **R√§umliche Informationssysteme**, are information systems designed for the **capture, processing, organization, analysis, and presentation of spatial data**. These systems encompass the necessary **hardware**, **software**, **data**, and **applications** to work with geographic information1[2](https://www.esri.de/de-de/was-ist-gis/uebersicht).

In more detail:

- **Purpose**: GIS technology combines geospatial science with tools to create maps, perform analyses, convey information, and address global challenges.
- **Components**:
  - **Hardware**: Includes computers, servers, GPS devices, and other physical equipment.
  - **Software**: GIS software allows users to manipulate and analyze spatial data.
  - **Data**: Geographic data (such as maps, satellite imagery, and sensor data) is a fundamental component.
  - **Applications**: GIS applications range from urban planning and environmental management to disaster response and business logistics.

For example, in **Bavaria, Germany**, the **Geoportal Bayern** serves as the central access point to geospatial data and services within the **Geodateninfrastruktur (GDI) Bayern**. It provides various map themes, including information about public institutions, land use planning, and administrative boundaries.
